1) –Determine how many times the output statement is displayed in each of the following fragments.  Indicate whether the algorithm is O(n) or O(n^2)

    a)for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      System.out.println(i + “ “ + j);
      }
    }

    i -> n is linear therefore the time complexity with respect to i is O(n)
    j -> n is also linear therefore the time complexity with respect to j is O(n)

    for each i printed through n, print j through n, therefore we can conclude that O(n)
    with respect to i * O(n) with respect to j = O(n^2)

2) the result doesnt surprise me because at a certain threshold, value of n is being doubled in y2
and eventually will be bigger than value of n*100 from y1
